# 👋 Hi, I’m Prani Gopu a.k.a. Pranav Gopalkrishna

Artificial intelligence is the subject of my choice for which I have a lot of time studying the theory and applying my knowledge in a variety of projects. My key motivations in studying AI were to (1) expand on the creative applications of AI systems and (2) integrate theory and practice to create well-founded and accessible solutions.

# Background
My background in computer science, especially with my extensive programming projects (mostly in Python, Java and C) in a variety of domains (both personal and academic; see: https://github.com/stars/pranigopu/lists/projects), has built up my creativity, problem-solving skills (including debugging skills) and most importantly, perseverance (mostly due to the many failed attempts, steep learning curves and debugging). Moreover, I document my work meticulously, so I have experience in making sure my work is as interpretable and accessible as possible.
 
My background in statistics, including applied statistics in my master's, adds to my learning and experience in machine learning (both theoretically and practically). I enjoy both mathematics and computer science, and putting them together has been a long-standing interest of mine. Furthermore, due to my last two major projects, I have substantial experience in designing, implementing (from scratch), training and tinkering with deep learning models (mostly working with Keras and Tensorflow). My work with machine learning models has produced well-motivated solutions (which have been well documented in my GitHub) for relatively unique and interesting applications, such as neural style transfer between an ambience and a music piece, or a musical key and tempo classification model.
 
# Project work
**Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis via Chrome Extension (2022)**

I worked in a team of 3 to create a Chrome extension scrapes a website’s text to analyse the text. The text mining and sentiment analysis functionality was implemented in Python by my teammate Hyeok Kim. My task was to create the Chrome extension itself. To access the Python-based functionality, I craeted a Django backend containing the Python code, to which the Chrome extension could send requests (e.g. for webscraping, text analysis, etc.) and receive the required data. For the interface, I created a popup displaying a word cloud, word frequency chart and sentiment pie chart. The prototype got us a 2nd place in the intra-college science fair.

**Enhancing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (2023)**

I collaborated with 2 teammates to improve the performance of an AI agent in playing the card game Sushi Go!. The team implemented and tested the effect of different bandit methods on the base MCTS algorithm. I had no contribution to the final code due to mediocre results in IS-MCTS (Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search) implementations. However, I was a major contributor to the final report.

**Implementing Reinforcement Learning (RL) Methods (2024)**

I collaborated with 2 teammates to implement and test RL methods for navigating a simple grid-based obstacle course. The methods included model-based, model-free and deep learning methods. Each member independently implemented all methods; I have given the link to my own implementations as well. Collaboration was done for the team report involving experiments.

**Implementing Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks for Music (2024)**

I implemented and trained (1) a convolutional neural network (CNN) for musical key recognition, and (2) a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) for tempo recognition. I designed and implemented preprocessing methods for audio data to be fed into the neural networks and created a post-processing system to combine and present the results of both models.

**Implementing Neural Style Transfer (NST) for audio (2024)**

I designed and trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for genre classification. I used the trained CNNs to implement NST for transferring the style of one musical piece (usually an ambient piece) to another. I implemented NST audio from scratch (using references). Finally, I created a Google Colab interface to run the NST for music pieces (to be given as audio files).

**Implementing Cellular Automata and Behaviour Trees (2024)**

I designed 3 cellular automata to procedurally generate “coral reef” terrains, along with 2 behaviour trees to handle two agents (player and attacking mermaid). The project was done using the Unity Game Engine, and was coded in C#.
