# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Prani Gopu a.k.a. Pranav Gopalkrishna

Artificial intelligence is the subject of my choice for which I have a lot of time studying the theory and applying my knowledge in a variety of projects. My key motivations in studying AI were to (1) expand on the creative applications of AI systems and (2) integrate theory and practice to create well-founded and accessible solutions.

# Background
My background in computer science, especially with my extensive programming projects (mostly in Python, Java and C) in a variety of domains (both personal and academic; see: https://github.com/stars/pranigopu/lists/projects), has built up my creativity, problem-solving skills (including debugging skills) and most importantly, perseverance (mostly due to the many failed attempts, steep learning curves and debugging). Moreover, I document my work meticulously, so I have experience in making sure my work is as interpretable and accessible as possible.
 
My background in statistics, including applied statistics in my master's, adds to my learning and experience in machine learning (both theoretically and practically). I enjoy both mathematics and computer science, and putting them together has been a long-standing interest of mine. Furthermore, due to my last two major projects, I have substantial experience in designing, implementing (from scratch), training and tinkering with deep learning models (mostly working with Keras and Tensorflow). My work with machine learning models has produced well-motivated solutions (which have been well documented in my GitHub; links are in my CV) for relatively unique and interesting applications, such as neural style transfer between an ambience and a music piece, or a musical key and tempo classification model.
 
# Project work
Over the course of my master's, I have had to consistently go through research papers to draw ideas from for my projects and/or to gain insights into the latest work in the relevant area. I have both an interest and substantial experience in implementing ideas from research papers from scratch. As for the implementations themselves, due to the complexity of the preprocessing and post-processing, and due to the need to tinker with various preprocessing and model parameters, I have had to work intensively on designing well-designed, interpretable and efficient training pipelines that would allow me to experiment freely. In general, one of my main areas of focus is a well-organised development and training process along with consistent documentation, which adds value (e.g. by showing what obstacles were encountered and overcome) and maintains the justifiability and accessibility of my development process. Below, I have listed some of my key projects.

**Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis via Chrome Extension (2022)**

- Worked in a team of 3 and gained collaborative and team management skills
- Created a Chrome extension for text mining and sentiment analysis of webpages
- The extension scrapes a website‚Äôs text to analyse the text
- The extension popup displays a word cloud, word frequency chart and sentiment pie chart
- The prototype got us a 2nd place in the intra-college science fair
- **Grade**: 81%
- **GitHub link**: https://github.com/pranigopu/sentiMiner

**Implementing Reinforcement Learning (RL) Methods (2024)**

- Collaborated with 2 teammates and gained peer-review skills
- Team implemented and tested RL methods for navigating a simple grid-based obstacle course
- Methods included model-based, model-free and deep learning methods
- Each member independently implemented all methods
- Collaboration was for the team report involving experiments
- **Grade**: 96%
- **GitHub link**: https://github.com/pranigopu/frozenLake (report present in ‚Äúreport/‚Äù as ‚ÄúfinalReport.pdf‚Äù)

**Implementing Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks for Music (2024)**

- Implemented and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) for musical key recognition
- Implemented and trained a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) for tempo recognition
- Designed and implemented preprocessing methods for audio data to be fed into the neural networks
- Created a post-processing system to combine and present the results of both models
- **Grade**: 65%
- **GitHub link**: https://github.com/pranigopu/key--tempo-deepLearning

**Implementing Neural Style Transfer (NST) for audio (2024)**

- Designed and trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for genre classification
- Used the trained CNNs to implement NST for transferring
- Implemented NST audio from scratch (using references)
- The goal was to transfer the style of one musical piece (e.g. ambience) to the content of another piece
- Created a Google Colab interface to run the NST for music pieces (to be given as audio files)
- **Grade**: 62%
- **GitHub link**: https://github.com/pranigopu/ambience-to-music-neuralStyleTransfer

**Enhancing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (2023)**

- Collaborated with 2 teammates and gained algorithm experimentation skills
- Team implemented and tested the effect of different bandit methods on the base MCTS algorithm
- The goal was to improve the performance of an AI agent in playing the card game Sushi Go
- Had no contribution to the final code due to mediocre results in IS-MCTS implementations
- Was a major contributor to the final report.
- **Grade**: 94%
- **GitHub link (team repository)**: https://github.com/grahaminn/AIinGames-Assignment1
- **Report link**: https://github.com/pranigopu/artificialIntelligence-in-games/blob/main/assignment1/REPORT.pdf

# My websites
Apart from my academic work, I also write, mainly on philosophical topics but also poetry, fiction and technical writing (such as explanatory documents on statistical concepts, mathematical concepts, etc.). I also collect art, visual and musicl my collection is available in my personal website made using GitHub Pages (link given below)

- Showcase website using WordPress: https://pranigopu.wordpress.com/
- Comprehensive writing and art collection using GitHub pages: https://pranigopu.github.io/
