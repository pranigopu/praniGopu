# Introduction
Artificial intelligence is the subject of my choice for which I have a lot of time studying the theory and applying my knowledge in a variety of projects. My key motivations in studying AI were to (1) expand on the creative applications of AI systems and (2) integrate theory and practice to create well-founded and accessible solutions.

# Background
I have a strong background in computer science, especially due to my extensive programming projects (mostly in Python, Java and C) in a variety of domains (both personal and academic; see: https://github.com/stars/pranigopu/lists/projects). I also have a strong background in statistics and mathematics. I enjoy both mathematics and computer science, and putting them together has been a long-standing interest of mine. Furthermore, due to my last two major projects, I have substantial experience in designing, implementing (from scratch), training and tinkering with deep learning models (mostly working with Keras and Tensorflow). My work with machine learning models has produced well-motivated solutions (which have been well documented in my GitHub) for relatively unique and interesting applications, such as neural style transfer between an ambience and a music piece, or a musical key and tempo classification model.
